I am a front-end developer, passionate about creating web interfaces and improving user experience. My approach to developing complex on React, TypeScript and CSS, with a special attention to accessibility and modern design methods.

My key skills and interests: React: I use React to build dynamic and interactive interfaces, making them simple and easy to use.
TypeScript: I write typed code that helps improve the quality and scalability of projects.
CSS: I create stylish and responsive designs using modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.
User Experience (UX): I focus on creating clear and pleasant interfaces that bring value to users.

I am an active supporter of the open source idea and am always open to collaborations and projects. If you have interesting ideas or are looking for a partner to implement solutions, I will be happy to discuss the possibilities of cooperation.
May the Force be with you.
